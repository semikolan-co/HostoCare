# Welcome to HostoCare

A platform in which the user can check and compare the availability of medical centers in their locality. Through the [App](http://github.com/semikolan/HostoCare-App) and [Web Interface](http://github.com/semikolan/HostoCare), the user can compare different hospitals, medical shops, Clinics and medical labs and their specifications such as the availability of beds, doctors etc.


## Problem
There are many instances where people are unable to find desired locations of hospitals or other medical facilities on time, due to various reasons such as lack of Information for medical assistance and any other Technical platforms to provide accurate data and check their affordability. Sometimes they don't get proper medication on time which can be critical as well.

## Our Aim

We have been working to create a proper platform in which the user can check and compare the availability of hospitals in their locality. Through the app and web interface, the user can compare the different hospitals, medical shops, Clinics nearby and their specifications such as the availability of beds and doctors. The user can also check the medical qualifications of the doctor and the time in which the doctor is available in a particular hospital or clinic.
**
The goal of our platform is to make healthcare accessible to all at their fingertips.**

## Targeting Audience & Conditions

In our country there are no better facilities for medication in rural areas or small towns so people tend to visit big cities and they don't have much information about which medical expert they should visit or which hospital provides better treatment. So we will try to target specially these types of people.

Also our services will be beneficial for all people who are in emergency conditions. And those who are looking to buy medicines or to check in any kind of medical experts ,our services will also be very good for them.

## Secondary Aim

To provide :

-   Full data of hospitals with availability of medical treatments , Doctors from different fields and their contact number and availability time in hospital , Number of ICU , beds and ventilators. Also their ratings.
    
-   Clinics of doctors and their qualifications , staff and services they provide.
    
-   Medical stores near you and medicines available there.
    
-   Medical labs and tests they provide and instruments they have .
    

In the emergency case there will be a direct button for Ambulance if you are away from a medical facility.
